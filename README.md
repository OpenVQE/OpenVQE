**OpenVQE** is an open-source extension of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) for quantum chemistry, building on the Quantum Learning Machine (QLM) and developed using tools from [`myqlm-fermion`](https://github.com/myQLM/myqlm-fermion.git). It enhances QLM's capabilities in quantum chemistry computations. This repository produce quantum computing applications. Please follows us as there will be more and more applications to coming.

## Key Publication
For a comprehensive overview, refer to the main OpenVQE paper:

*Open Source Variational Quantum Eigensolver Extension of the Quantum Learning Machine (QLM) for Quantum Chemistry.*  
M. Haidar, M. J. Rančić, T. Ayral, Y. Maday, J.-P. Piquemal, *WIREs Comp. Mol. Sci.*, 2023, e1664 (Open Access)  
DOI: [10.1002/wcms.1664](https://doi.org/10.1002/wcms.1664)


## Modules


1. **UCC Family**: this module consists of different classes and functions to generate the fermionic cluster operators (fermionic pool) and the  qubit pools and to get the optimized energies from VQE in the case of active and non-active orbital selections. For example, UCCSD, QUCCSD, UCCGSD, K-UpCCGSD, spin-complemented pair, singlet and doublet generalized single and double excitations, etc.

2. **ADAPT**: Contains two sub-modules:
    - Fermionic-ADAPT: it contains functions that performs the fermionic ADAPT-VQE algorthmic steps  in the active and non-active space selections.
    - Qubit-ADAPT: it  contains functions that perform the Qubit ADAPT-VQE algorithmic steps calculation in the active and non-active space orbital selections.
3. **Applications**: Contains practical quantum computing applications:
    - **quantum_batteries**: Simulation of lithium-ion batteries on quantum computer.
4. **Algorithms**: Wrapper to compute use VQE on selected molecules using selected method. Available methods are: 
    - **Fermionic adapt**: Implements the fermionic ADAPT-VQE algorithm.
    - **Qubit adapt**: Implements the qubit ADAPT-VQE algorithm.
    - **QUCCSD**: Implements the qubit unitary coupled cluster with single and double excitations algorithm.
    - **UCC**: Implements the unitary coupled cluster algorithm.

5. **ucc_family**: This module compute the energy of the UCC or QUCC circuit.

Installation
--------------

OpenVQE can only be installed on a linux distribution because of its depencies with pyscf and cuda-quantum. If you are on windows or mac, use docker, wsl or a virtual machine to create a linux environment.

To install OpenVQE from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenVQE/OpenVQE.git
cd OpenVQE
git checkout alpha
pip install .
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To explore the quantum battery application, you will need to install CUDA and have an NVIDIA GPU. For detailed instructions, refer to the    [NVIDIA CUDA Quantum GitHub page](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum).

## Troubleshooting

If you have a problem with the installation we recommand using `conda`:

```shell
conda create --name openvqe python=3.11
conda activate openvqe
# Repeat the installation steps above
git clone https://github.com/OpenVQE/OpenVQE.git
cd OpenVQE
git checkout alpha
pip install .
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To explore the quantum battery application, you will need to install CUDA and have an NVIDIA GPU. For detailed instructions, refer to the    [NVIDIA CUDA Quantum GitHub page](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum). If you want to install it on linux do:
```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install cuda-11-8 -y
```

If you have the error: `Qiskit is installed in an invalid environment that has both Qiskit >=1.0 and an earlier version.`. Run the command: `pip uninstall qiskit-terra` inside your terminal.
