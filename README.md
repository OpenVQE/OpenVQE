OpenVQE: README
=======================

`OpenVQE` is an Open Source Variational Quantum Eigensolver extension of the Quantum Learning Machine to  Quantum Chemistry. It was developed based on the tools of `myqlm-fermion` 

Check the main OpenVQE paper:

It consists of two main modules as follows:

- UCC Family: this module consists of different classes and functions to generate the fermionic cluster operators (fermionic pool) and the  qubit pools and to get the optimized energies from VQE in the case of active and non-active orbital selections. For example, UCCSD, QUCCSD, UCCGSD, K-UpCCGSD, spin-complemented pair, singlet and doublet generalized single and double excitations, etc.

- ADAPT: consists of two sub-modules which are: 
    - Fermionic-ADAPT: it contains functions that performs the fermionic ADAPT-VQE algorthmic steps  in the active and non-active space selections.
    - Qubit-ADAPT: it  contains functions that perform the Qubit ADAPT-VQE algorithmic steps calculation in the active and non-active space orbital selections.
